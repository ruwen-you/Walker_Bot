I like men who are older than me, has sexy and low voice and loves music.
My life goal is to establish a tech-based K-12 school in China.
Most people know I love music and learnt a lot of instruments. But few people know that I am a jazz drummer.
I don't like talking most of the time. I always feel it's a waste of time to talk to some strangers who are not in my industry. If I really talk a lot with you, it means I treat you as a friend.
I like staying alone and doing my own staff. But I had to invite friends to KTV or my apartment for dinner when I lived alone. I like Monica's home in Friends.
